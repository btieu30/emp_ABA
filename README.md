## Tests Performed
* Created 4 arrays total of lengths 1,000,000, 5,000,000, 10,000,000, and 50,000,000, containing consecutive multiples of 2 starting with 0.
* Conducted 100 binary searches and 100 linear searches of each array for a random integer between 0 and twice the array length (0 and the maximum value in the array). 
  * This guaranteed that the chance of the target not being in the array would be the same for arrays of all lengths  (50%, since there would be a 50% chance of the target being odd). This way, the results would not be skewed due      to the target not being found more frequently for shorter array lengths - such an error would result in             deceptively longer average times for shorter arrays.
* For each search, the elapsed time was found by subtracting the timestamp directly before the search from the     timestamp directly after the search. Then, the average elapsed time for each set of 100 searches was found.
* We displayed the average elapsed times for the binary searches and linear searches for each array, as well as the difference between the average elapsed times for binary search and linear search for each array. 

## Results
* For the 1,000,000-length, 5,000,000-length, 10,000,000-length, and 50,000,000-length arrays, the average elapsed times for linear search were 1, 6, 12, and 58 seconds, respectively, and the average elapsed times for binary search were 0, 0, 0, and 0 seconds, respectively.
* The difference between the average elapsed times for linear search and binary search were 1, 6, 12, and 58 seconds, respectively.
* Repetitions of this experiment always yielded elapsed times of 1 second for the shortest array (1,000,000) and elapsed times of 0 seconds for binary search for all arrays.
* The average elapsed times for linear search of the other 3 arrays never differed from these results by more than a few seconds (no more than 1 second for the 5,000,000- and 10,000,000-length arrays and no more than 5 seconds for the 50,000,000-length array) and the difference between the average elapsed times for linear and binary search for the other 3 arrays also never differed from these results by the corresponding amounts.

## Conclusions
* Binary search appears to be more efficient than linear search, as it was always faster than linear search.
* The difference in efficiency appears to become more pronounced as the length of the array being searched increases.
* Moreover, binary search does not appear to decrease in efficiency by a significant amount as the array length increases, at least up to lengths that the system's memory can handle, since it took approximately 0 seconds for all array lengths.
